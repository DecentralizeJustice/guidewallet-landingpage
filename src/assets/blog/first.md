If I don't Someone Else Will
========================
Week 1/28

If I don't don't get this wallet to work someone else will, is one of the
thoughts that kept me going through the past 2 weeks of working on Guiding Wallet.
A wallet focused on using the best cryptos will be popular one day, just not this week.
But this week I was able to get the trivia show up and running which was great.
The goal of the trivia show is to get the wallet in front of people in a more sustainable
way than paying for advertising or other growth channels. HQ Trivia has shown
that people enjoy scheduled games like this, and I think people would enjoy the
game also. I mean I enjoyed playing a lot and I already knew the answers.
Although I think the game is fun, only one person showed up. This is major problem,
but the good news is I only advertised in 3 facebook groups. With the bitcoin
bullrun education seems to get lost in the "when moon" and "what coins to buy" conversation.
In order to target a community that is focused on using crypto I'm going to make content for the Monero community.
Monero is a crypto focused on privacy and has one of the most focused and committed
communities around. I think they will enjoy my education focused trivia show more,
I hope at least. If you found this useful or what to know more about a certain aspect let me know.
